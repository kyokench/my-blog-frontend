feat: Implement basic blog structure and styling

This commit introduces the foundational elements for the blog's frontend, including:

- **Shared Layout**: Added a common header and footer to `src/app/layout.tsx` for consistent navigation and branding across all pages.
- **Homepage Enhancement**: Refactored `src/app/page.tsx` to display blog posts in a card-based layout, fetching `mainImage` and `publishedAt` from Sanity. A new `PostCard` component was created in `src/components/PostCard.tsx` for reusability.
- **Post Detail Page Styling**: Updated `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` to properly render Sanity Portable Text content using `@portabletext/react`. Also added display for post images and publication dates.
- **About Page**: Created a new static "About" page at `src/app/about/page.tsx`.
- **Type Definitions**: Updated `src/types/post.ts` to include `mainImage` and `publishedAt` fields.
- **Dependencies**: Installed `@portabletext/react` for rich text rendering.
